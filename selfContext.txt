using stub to check if the compiler is called on each execution

$filter is to directlt filter out contents - if needed to transform we must use $type and call $tranform within that

The direct filters usually represent each set of json (for each objects in the array)
eg:In array1: [ { a: 1, b: 'x' } , { a: 2, b: 'y' }, { a: 3, b: 'z' } ], Here {a:1, b:x} is one set of json(first array object)
So The filer will be [{a: number},{b: string}] -  this will be applied across all array objects


If using explicit initial context - The values sent in target will get replaced by input values that passes the filter - based on the array index
Suppose if 
123456 is the target and in input if we have 
789 - If 8 gets filtered out and only 7 and 9 passess, the output will be 
729456
